<td align="left"><p>I am a software engineer working in AI SW-HW codesign at Meta.
Broadly, I work on
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>numerical algorithm codesign and performance optimization for Meta's proprietary AI accelerator <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/next-generation-meta-training-inference-accelerator-AI-MTIA/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>MTIA</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>codesign novel ML models/algorithms to make efficient use of HW (e.g., 2nd order optimizers such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09568" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Shampoo</a> that won AlgoPerf contest)
</p>
</li>
<li><p>performance optimization for existing training workloads (mostly ranking/recommendation) on GPU
</p>
</li>
<li><p>performance modeling/projection for future GPU, MTIA above
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to this, I was a power and performance engineer at Apple working on Siri, responsible for
making Siri run fast while not consuming too much power. I am especially
interested in efficient algorithms that make great use of available hardware.
</p>
<p>Before joining Apple, I was a security/privacy engineer at <a href="https://snap.com" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Snap Inc.</a>.
At Snap, I work on end to end encryption, privacy preserving ads solutions, and
other problems at the intersection of cryptography and software engineering at scale.
</p>
<p>Before joining industry, I defended my <a href="doc/phd_thesis.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Ph.D. thesis</a> titled <b>&ldquo;Fourier Analysis on the Hypercube, the Coefficient Problem, and Applications&rdquo;</b> on April 15, 2020.
</p>
<p>My graduate work in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (<a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>EECS</a>) department at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>MIT</a>
was supervised jointly by <a href="http://allegro.mit.edu/~gww/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Gregory Wornell</a> in the
<a href="http://www.rle.mit.edu/sia" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Signals, Information, and Algorithms Laboratory</a>
within the Research Laboratory of Electronics (<a href="http://www.rle.mit.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>RLE</a>),
and <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~cohn/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Henry Cohn</a>, a senior principal researcher at Microsoft Research, New England and
an adjunct professor in the <a href="https://math.mit.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>MIT Department of Mathematics</a>.
</p>
<p>Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate work in the
<a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/course-6-2-electrical-eng-computer-science" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>EECS 6-2</a>
program at MIT. While an undergraduate, I worked with
<a href="http://ssg.mit.edu/~willsky/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Alan Willsky</a> during my freshman year.
I also worked with
<a href="http://people.lids.mit.edu/yp/homepage/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Yury Polyanskiy</a>, with whom I
completed a
<a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/eecs-super-urop/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>'Super&rsquo; UROP</a>.
</p>
<p>My research during graduate school spanned a wide range of mathematical problems,
grouped nicely under the heading <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-s18/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>point configurations</a>.
I thought about such questions in discrete spaces, especially Hamming space.
Naturally, techniques for approaching such questions are varied, ranging over
probability, combinatorics, number theory, and numerical computation.

I am a software engineer working in AI SW-HW codesign at Meta.
Broadly, I work on
- numerical algorithm codesign and performance optimization for Meta's proprietary AI accelerator [https://ai.meta.com/blog/next-generation-meta-training-inference-accelerator-AI-MTIA/ MTIA].
- codesign novel ML models/algorithms to make efficient use of HW (e.g., 2nd order optimizers such as [https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09568 Shampoo] that won AlgoPerf contest)
- performance optimization for existing training workloads (mostly ranking/recommendation) on GPU
- performance modeling/projection for future GPU, MTIA above

Prior to this, I was a power and performance engineer at Apple working on Siri, responsible for
making Siri run fast while not consuming too much power. I am especially
interested in efficient algorithms that make great use of available hardware.

Before joining Apple, I was a security/privacy engineer at [https://snap.com Snap Inc.].
At Snap, I work on end to end encryption, privacy preserving ads solutions, and
other problems at the intersection of cryptography and software engineering at scale.

Before joining industry, I defended my [doc/phd_thesis.pdf Ph.D. thesis] titled *"Fourier Analysis on the Hypercube, the Coefficient Problem, and Applications"* on April 15, 2020.

My graduate work in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science ([https://www.eecs.mit.edu EECS]) department at [http://web.mit.edu/ MIT]
was supervised jointly by [http://allegro.mit.edu/~gww/ Prof. Gregory Wornell] in the
[http://www.rle.mit.edu/sia Signals, Information, and Algorithms Laboratory]
within the Research Laboratory of Electronics ([http://www.rle.mit.edu/ RLE]),
and [https://math.mit.edu/~cohn/ Prof. Henry Cohn], a senior principal researcher at Microsoft Research, New England and
an adjunct professor in the [https://math.mit.edu/ MIT Department of Mathematics].

Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate work in the
[https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/course-6-2-electrical-eng-computer-science EECS 6-2]
program at MIT. While an undergraduate, I worked with
[http://ssg.mit.edu/~willsky/ Prof. Alan Willsky] during my freshman year.
I also worked with
[http://people.lids.mit.edu/yp/homepage/ Prof. Yury Polyanskiy], with whom I
completed a
[https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/eecs-super-urop/ 'Super' UROP].

My research during graduate school spanned a wide range of mathematical problems,
grouped nicely under the heading [https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-s18/ point configurations].
I thought about such questions in discrete spaces, especially Hamming space.
Naturally, techniques for approaching such questions are varied, ranging over
probability, combinatorics, number theory, and numerical computation.
